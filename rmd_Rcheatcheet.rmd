# Collection of useful R syntax and methods

## Introduction

This document is intended to collect all the useful code snippets I have collected since I started using R and R studio.

I intend to organise the snippets into sections.

* data wrangling.
* data restructuring
* data manipulation (creating new variables)
* statistical analysis â€“ basic
* statistical analysis - advanced
* data visualisation

ultimately, I want this to be a working document with examples to run. I will load the required libraries when they are needed
